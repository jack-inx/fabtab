If you access the Service through Facebook Connect , you understand that some content and/or information in your Facebook account (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or request, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified and provide that anonymized information to our partners. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to allow our advertisers to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. We might use the fact you have purchased or inquired about a certain brand of apparel, for instance, to show you advertisements for the company that sells that brand, but we will not tell that company who you are.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1"  style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px">B. Information Collected Automatically:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your computer’s or device’s acceptance of cookies, but doing so may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website’s best features. Our advertising partners may transmit cookies to your computer or device when you click on ads that appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover cookies delivered to you by any of our advertisers.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website and to which pages within the Website), we only use such data in aggregate form, in a manner that assures your anonymity. We may provide this aggregate usage information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website, so that our partners, too, can endeavor to provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, we may place a cookie on your device that records what products you have viewed on our Website, and then provide that information, in non-personally-identifiable form, to a third party website, to allow such website to show you ads for similar products that are available from us or from third parties.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We may also deliver a file to you through the Website (known as a "web beacon") from an advertising network we have contracted with. Web beacons allow advertising networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. These beacons may, for example, log that you have viewed a certain product on our Website, and then show you an ad for similar products when you browse to another website. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Many ad networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards, and such NAI members may allow you to opt-out of cookies or beacons they deliver. Again, we do not control the policies of any third parties, including advertising networks.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1"  style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px">C. E-mail and Other Communications:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px; ">We may contact you, by email or other means. For example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of the Website. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by changing your account setting.</div>

  <div class="promo_text1"  style="margin-bottom:0px;">Will MyFabTab Inc share any of the personal information it received?</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties only as described below:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1"  style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;">A. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that we deem it related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit information from your MyFabTab Inc account to an account on a third party website or service, such as Facebook. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’s or websites’ policies.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1"  style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;">B. Agents:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we inform you otherwise, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what we deem necessary to assist us in performing such tasks.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;">C. User Profiles and Content:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user’s username and the image content that such user has uploaded to the website may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website or address your request for our services. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your username may also be displayed to other users if and when you post comments or upload images through the Website and other users can contact you through such comments. If you sign into the Services through Facebook Connect, your list of “friends” from Facebook may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1"style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;" >D. Business Transfers:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information (which may include your Personal Information) is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;">E. Protection of MyFabTab Inc and Others:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with laws; enforce or apply our conditions of use and/or other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of MyFabTab Inc, our employees, our users, or others. We may exchange information with other companies and organizations (including governmental authorities) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-top:0px;">F. With Your Consent:</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</div>


  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Is the personal information about me secure?</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via Facebook Connect, you may have additional or different sign-on protections through Facebook. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password (or other sign-on protections) appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Changes to this privacy policy</div>
  <div class="promo_text1" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or contacting you directly via email or other means. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.</div>
